# 31-EDO scale and chord visualizer

Does what it says on the tin. Just a React SPA.

The scripts to generate the scales seem pretty solid, but there are also some weird chords in there. 

If you want to help me out and either upgrade the logic, or directly add some new scales, then I'd be eternally grateful.

## Be a good soul
This has the following issues:
- When playing scales, the notes highlighted on the keyboard are out of sync with the audio.
- Advanced scale selection is a bit useless:
  - It needs, like, search & filter, or something.
  - Progressive loading for the big chord categories
